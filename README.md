GitHub intro
My name is Ted Roper. I am a PhD student in the Litvak Lab at the University of New Mexico. I am interested in many facets of biology but my primary interests lie in plant and ecosystems ecology. My current research is focused on the relationship between grassland community composition/structure and carbon cycling dynamics, a relationship I am examining through differential responses to environmental conditions. I am looking at two grassland communities in the Sevilleta NWR - a mixed grassland site and a black grama dominated site.
